## Overview
As data from various sources and stakeholders becomes central to powering machine learning pipelines, the need for collaborative learning techniques is more crucial than ever. Federated learning, for example, is poised to revolutionize the field by facilitating secure and coordinated learning across different parties and heterogeneous data sets. To achieve this, innovative strategies must be developed to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of learning with isolated data; reduce risks while safeguarding data privacy and ownership; and integrate social and economic incentives that encourage data sharing and establish reliable cooperative learning frameworks.
**The objective of this course is to introduce the state-of-the-art systems, algorithms, and applications in federated learning.** Topics to be covered include but are not limited to:
- Distributed optimization
- Data heterogeneity in federated learning
- System heterogeneity in federated learning
- Security and privacy in federated learning
- federated learning with emerging foundation models

## Grading Policy (subject to change)
The requirements for this course include active participation in and leadership of discussion sessions, as well as the completion of a course project. The grading breakdown is as follows:
- **Paper review (30%):** Each non-presenter student need to review one of the two discussed papers every week, the format follows the instructions and template of NeurIPS conference. The details will be explained in the lecture and the template will uploaded to Canvas.
- **Paper presentation and discussion (30%):** Each student needs to present two selected papers throughout the semester and lead the discussion for each paper. Non-presenter need to prepare at least one question for each presented paper in the discussion.
- **Project (40%)**: e
